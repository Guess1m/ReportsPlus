## Overview

- ReportsPlus was designed to act as an external MDT that can be used from another device (Windows/Mac Desktop) to
  create reports, receive actual game data, and make the LSPDFR experience much more immersive.


- ReportsPlus really shines when used from a separate system you have next to you, as it mimics an actual MDT, however,
  you can use it from the same system if you don't have access to another laptop you can use.


- ReportsPlus is not just typing reports like the name may suggest, as ReportsPlus has a fully functioning court system,
  lookup system for peds and vehicles, callout popups, ID popups when asking for them, tons of customization and report
  types, full language translation, and SO MUCH more than I can list here.


- This is not a window that opens in game such as something like CompuLite, it is an external application which connects
  to your game to be able to receive actual game data.
