## Troubleshooting

- If on Mac, I have had issues with the application if it's in a folder that iCloud backs up, I believe this has
  to do with the Sync messing with the files, I recommend moving the application to a folder that is not backed up by
  iCloud. Putting the ReportsPlus folder in the `{user}\Applications` folder has worked fine for me, this directory
  shouldn't be getting backed up by iCloud.
- If you are getting a blank ID or Callout windows, try closing both the application and server and relaunching both then
  reconnecting to the server. This is likely caused by the messages from the server getting out of sync, I'm currently
  working on a fix.
